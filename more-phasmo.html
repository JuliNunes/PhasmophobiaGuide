					<h3 class="byline">Spirit Box</h3>
					<p class="text">
						Spirit Box is really simple, just turn it on and ask
						questions to the Ghost in the Ghost Room you don't need
						to say the Ghost name, just ask the question, the best
						way is ask questions fast so you get an answer fast too,
						I like asking "Where are you?", "Are you here?" and
						"What do you want?".
					</p>
					<p class="text">
						There is a good trick, just let the Spirit Box on and
						you don't even need to ask any question! If the ghost
						has Spirit Box it will eventually say something. I
						personally don't like doing this too much because the
						Spirit Box sound is annoying and it gets in the way of
						other sounds, like doors closing or objects being
						thrown, but it is something useful anyhow.
					</p>
				</section>
				<hr class="divider" />
				<section id="ghost-book">
					<h3 class="byline">Ghost Writing Book</h3>
					<p class="text">
						There is no trick here, just put the book inside the
						ghost room, sometimes it takes forever and sometimes the
						Ghost writes it pretty fast.
					</p>
					<p class="text">
						I lied, there is one small trick to know if there isn't
						Ghost Writing, if you see the ghost throwing the book
						you can be sure there won't be any Ghost Writing. I like
						to put the Ghost Book right below or on top of D.O.T.S
						so I know if the book moved a little.
					</p>

				<section id="emf">
					<h3 class="byline">EMF Reader</h3>
					<p class="text">
						If you hear something being thrown run there and put
						that EMF Reader to work EMF is really useful to take
						photos too, if the EMF is beeping you can still take a
						picure of what was interacted with.
					</p>
					<ol class="list-none">
						<li>
							<span id="emf2">EMF 2:</span> Ghost interacted with

					<h3 class="byline">UV Flashlight</h3>
					<p class="text">
						Nothing new to say here really, if you hear a door
						opening of closing run there with your UV Flashlight (or
						Glowstick) and check for fingerprints. Also check light
						switches if the Ghost turned any light on or off, check
						windows if you hear the Ghost hitting a window and check
						for footprints if the Ghost step on salt.
					</p>
				</section>
				<hr class="divider" />
				<section id="flash">
					<h3 class="byline">Flashlight</h3>
					<p class="text">
						This Flashlight is weaker than the stronger flashlight
						and has a yellow light (while the strong one is white).
						I personally only play with the weak one, for me it
						makes the game a little more scarier and hard and I
						enjoy it, but that's a very personal choice.
					</p>

				<section id="video">
					<h3 class="byline">Video Camera</h3>
					<p class="text">
						You can use the Video Camera by holding it and walking
						around the house looking at the video screen, you might
						see some Ghost Orbs.
					</p>
					<p class="text">
						Placing the Video Camera in a good place that you can
						see most of the room will make the game a lot easier.
					</p>
				</section>
				<hr class="divider" />
				<section id="photo">
					<h3 class="byline">Photo Camera</h3>
					<p class="text">
						Really useful to make some fat money, my advice is,
						always take pictures of door interaction if you do get
						fingerprints take 2 pictures, the next one will count as
						interaction.
					</p>
					<p class="text">
						Some people don't know that different photos means
						different money points, you need at least 500 points to
						get maximum money ($40), 400 to 499 points gives you
						$35, 300 to 399 $30 and goes on. Also, remember to take
						pictures close to what you want because that means how
						many stars you will get and how many points, here is the
						list of what gives more money points (I will only show 3
						star points):
					</p>
					<ol class="list-none">
						<li>Ghost: 100 points</li>
						<li>Bone: 70</li>
						<li>Cursed possession: 60</li>
						<li>Fingerprints: 50</li>
						<li>Footprints and interaction: 40</li>
						<li>Dirty water: 35</li>
						<li>Dead body: 30</li>
					</ol>
					<p class="text">
						That means if you want to make maximum money photo ($40)
						you need to take at least take photo of: Ghost, Bone,
						Cursed possession, and 7 footprints and / or interaction
						(all 3 stars). There are other combos that might make
						you reach 500 points.
					</p>
				</section>

				<section id="dots">
					<h3 class="byline">D.O.T.S Projector</h3>
					<p class="text">
						The best way to use DOTS is by putting it in a place
						that covers most of the Ghost Room, if you have 2 DOTS
						put one a little far away from the other so you can
						cover more of the room. I also don't recomment put it
						too close to a Video Camera because the camera will be
						too bright to see something.

						Candles slow sanity drain in the darkness and also

						The Ghost will ocasionally blow out a candle that is in
						4 meters range of him and the candle will extinguish if

						Bone is a Cursed Item that will appear in EVERY GAME. It

						Just have a quick look at it, if you know the map it
						will more than enough, if you see nothing compromising
						then maybe wait a little and look again, since waiting
						will make the ghost look elsewhere on the room.
					</p>
					<p class="text">
						It will drain the player using the mirror sanity by 10%
						very quick, and will break if it reaches 0%.

					<h3 class="byline">Music Box</h3>
					<p class="text">
						When activated walk around the map to find the Ghost,
						you will hear the singing louder the closer you are to
						the Ghost. If you get to at least 5 meters of the Ghost
						it will manifest and walk towards the Music Box.
					</p>
					<p class="text">
						If the Ghost touches the player with the Music Box or
						walk more than 5 seconds or the Music Box get thrown it
						will start a cursed hunt. If the Music Box is placed on
						the ground it won't hunt.
					</p>
					<p class="text">
						If the player using the Music Box reaches 0% sanity it
						will initiate a normal hunt.

					<p class="text">
						Listening to the entire song will drain 75% sanity of
						any player that hears it.

					<h3 class="byline">Ouija Board</h3>
					<p class="text">
						Ask a question, get an answer, the best question to ask
						is "Where are you?" so you know what room exactly the
						ghost is, but it will drain 40% sanity of the player
						that asked the question, if you already know where the
						ghost is, don't ask this. You can also ask "Do you
						respond to everyone?" to know if the Ghost responds the
						Spirit Box only if you are alone or not (it will drain
						20% sanity).
					</p>
					<p class="text">
						Ouija is good to trick a EMF 5 if the Ghost has that
						evidence you can ask questions that drain 5% sanity (the
						lowest), for example "How are you?" try asking 2 to 3
						times to check if it will have an EMF 5 (there's a 25%
						chance of happening if that's an evidence).
					</p>
					<p class="text">
						Another useful use is taking picture of every question,
						it will count as interaction, so ask 5% sanity question
						and take as many pictures as you want (1 pic per
						question).

						It can be used up to 10 times, using it drops 5% sanity
