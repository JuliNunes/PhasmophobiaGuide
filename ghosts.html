						<h3>Tips</h3>
						<li>
							When Smudged, can't hunt for 3 minutes instead of
							the normal 1.5 minutes.
						</li>
						<h3>Test</h3>
						<p>
							There is no good test for the Spirit, but when your
							team is at 0% sanity and the ghost is hunting
							constantly you you can smudge it and count if it
							will take 3 minutes or more to begin another hunt.
						</p>

						Wraith
					</li>
					<ul class="ghost-description" hidden id="wraith">
						<h3>Tips</h3>
						<li>
							Can't leave footsteps. Be sure to only check for
							feet if you hear footsteps before assuming it's a
							wraith. It's possible the ghost doesn't move after
							stepping in salt.
						</li>
						<li>
							Can teleport to your location and leave and EMF 2
							(or EMF 5). If an EMF 2/5 happens and you saw/heard
							nothing, start thinking Wraith.
						</li>
						<li>Can teleport to you while using the music box.</li>
						<h3>Test</h3>
						<p>
							The best way to test if it's a Wraith is by putting
							salt on it's room and waiting for it to step on it
							and walk, if there is no footprint it's 90% a Wraith
							(that 10% is a possibility to be a Mimic mimicking
							the Wraith at that moment, so be careful if there is
							a suspition of Mimic.)

						Phantom
					</li>
					<ul class="ghost-description" hidden id="phantom">
						<h3>Tips</h3>
						<li>
							Will disappear when you take a photo. You can know
							it's a phantom for sure if your photo doesn't have
							any glitch effect to it, but it still says "Ghost".
						</li>
						<li>
							Will blink or flash much less frequently during a
							hunt. If the ghost gets invisible for a more seconds
							than normal it's a phantom.
						</li>
						<h3>Test</h3>
						<p>
							There are two ways to see if it's a Phantom, when it
							does a ghost event try your best to take a picture
							of it, if he is not there but you see "ghost" on the
							album and there is no glitch effect, well... it's a
							Phantom.
						</p>
						<p>
							The other way to test is by looking at it when it's
							hunting, if he gets invisible for too long it's a
							Phantom, at first will be hard to tell, but with
							some practice you will be able to tell the
							difference between a Phantom and other ghosts really
							easy.

					<ul class="ghost-description" hidden id="polter">
						<h3>Tips</h3>
						<li>
							Can throw a bunch of things at once. A good way to
							test is by making a pile of objects in his room and
							see if he will throw them all (or most) at the same
							exact time.
						</li>
						<h3>Test</h3>
						<p>
							Poltergeist test is fun, you have to put many items
							in the middle of his room, if he throw all, or most,
							items at the same time, you know it's a Polter
							(remember, The Mimic, can mess up all tests that I
							show here).

						Banshee
					</li>
					<ul class="ghost-description" hidden id="banshee">
						<h3>Tips</h3>
						<li>
							Can only kill one person who is the target at a
							time, that means if you are not the target you can
							walk directly to him and he will ignore you (good
							luck finding out if you are or not the target).
						</li>
						<li>
							If the target is not in the house he will hunt
							normally being able to kill anyone he sees.
						</li>
						<li>
							Hunts are based on the target's sanity instead of
							the average sanity like other ghosts.
						</li>
						<li>
							More likely to do singing ghost events and will
							drain the target's sanity more when performing a
							ghost event on them.
						</li>
						<li>
							Has a unique scream that can be heard with the
							parabolic microphone.
						</li>
						<h3>Test</h3>
						<p>
							Banshee test can be tricky, all live members of your
							team have to be inside the house you must pick one
							to be a bait, the bait should be the only one not
							hiding and is best to be in a place where is not
							normally where the ghost walk (for example behind
							the kitchen balcony on Willow Street) if the ghost
							completly ignores you, you can be sure it's a
							Banshee and you are not it's target. If it comes to
							you I'll hope you have a smudge stick ready. Then
							you can try again with another bait, the Banshee can
							only have one target and it doens't change unless
							the target is not inside the house or it died.

						<h3>Tips</h3>
						<li>Can't turn off the breaker.</li>
						<li>
							Will be faster while farther away when the breaker
							is on (if it's off he can't use that abillity).
						</li>
						<li>
							Has a random chance to drain 25% sanity with no
							visual or audio queues when close you're close
							enough to it.
						</li>
						<h3>Test</h3>
						<p>
							Jinn test is very tricky for me personally, if the
							generator is on and he is fast when far away from
							people, you can try to turn the generator off and
							check if he still has the same speed.

						<h3>Tips</h3>
						<li>Can't turn on lights.</li>
						<li>More likely to roam from rooms with lights on.</li>
						<li>
							Can hunt earlier (60%) with the lights off and later
							(40%) with lights on.
						</li>
						<li>More likely to explode lights.</li>
						<h3>Test</h3>
						<p>
							For Mare, you turn on the light of her room and see
							he she is burning crucifixes or hunting inside the
							room, if she hunts with the light on, you can be
							sure it's not a Mare, if she turns the light off and
							then hunts or start a hunt outside the room where
							the light is off it's probably a Mare.

						<li>
							Extremely fast when it has line of sight of a

							one.
						</li>
						<h3>Test</h3>
						<p>
							Revenant for me is one of the most easy to tell,
							just wait for it to hunt and stay hidden, listen
							closely to it's steps, Revenant steps when he sees
							no one is EXTREMELY slow. You can also try to do the
							test again but this time letting it see you, but I
							won't recommend that since he will be EXTREMELY fast
							chasing you, even with a smudge ready you might miss
							it.

						<li>
							Can't interact with anything or junt when someone is
							in the same room.
						</li>
						<li>More likely to do non-physical ghost events.</li>
						<h3>Test</h3>
						<p>
							I like to say that, if the ghost is extremely
							boring, it's probably a Shade. If it's not hunting
							and not doing anything you can get your people out
							of the house and let only one there, if it start
							interacting more is probably a Shade, also if it
							start hunts far from it's room when there are people
							there you can think Shade too. (Remember that Shade
							only start huntings at 35% sanity)

						</li>
						<li>
							Smudges during hunt don't last as long than the

						</li>
						<li>
							Are affected by crucifixes from a much larger
							distance (5m instead the normal 3m).
						</li>
						<h3>Test</h3>
						<p>
							I don't think there's actually a test for Demon,
							well, if it start hunting when you just got in the
							house it's a Demon (or a Mimic, of course), also you
							can check if it eats crucifixes really fast, or is
							hunting constantly can be an indicative of a Demon.
						</p>
						<p>
							Other way to know is if it start the hunt at the
							beggining go check your team sanity, if it is
							between 70% and 60% it's probably a Demon

							Can close a door completely and it will drain of 15%
							sanity of nearby players.
						</li>
						<li>
							Smudging will prevent roaming for 90 seconds (not
							during a hunt).
						</li>
						<h3>Test</h3>
						<p>
							If you are not in Nighmare Mode you can check your
							sanity constantly, if it's dropping weirdly fast,
							you can suspect Yurei.
						</p>
						<p>
							You can also pay close attention to doors, if there
							is a door completely open and the ghost closes it
							completely you can be sure it's a Yurei (again, it
							could be a Mimic).

						<li>
							Has very strong throws, if something was thrown very

						</li>
						<h3>Test</h3>
						<p>
							I don't think there is a test for Oni, but you can
							suspect it's him if it is doing too much ghost
							events, specially at the beggining of the round.
						</p>
						<p>
							Also, if he does the air ball event it's not an Oni.

						<li>
							Has a hard time finding players because it cannot

						</li>
						<h3>Test</h3>
						<p>
							You and your team are talking too much and the ghost
							is mad? Might be an Yokai.
						</p>
						<p>
							You can also test by calling it when it's hunting,
							if it is too dumb to find you it might be an Yokai.
							It's specially easy to test this on Willow Street,
							you have to stay behind the glass kitchen door
							closed and with your flashligh on, if your flahsligh
							is flashing and the ghost goes to the garage or
							elsere that is not to you, it's an Yokai

						<h3>Test</h3>
						<p>
							No D.O.T.S yet? Get everyone out of its room and
							check on the camera. Now you see D.O.T.S? It's
							(probably) an Goryo.
						</p>
						<p>
							To be sure you must have someone by the door of the
							ghost room (but outside) and you look at the camera
							and your friend looks in person only you saw the
							D.O.T.S? Then it's a Goryo, also if someone saw
							D.O.T.S in person you can take Goryo out of the list

						<li>
							The only noise quieter than other ghosts during a

						</li>
						<h3>Test</h3>
						<p>
							Listen closely to the ghost footsteps, if it really
							low you can suspect Myling
						</p>
						<p>
							Another way to tell is by dropping a flashligh on by
							your hiding spot and pay attention if you can only
							hear the footsteps when the flashligh is flashing.
							With other ghosts you will be able to hear the

						<h3>Tips</h3>
						<li>
							Can hunt as early as 60% sanity unless there is a
							candel nearby.
						</li>
						<li>More likely to blow out candles.</li>
						<li>
							After 3 candles have been blown out, each
							consecutive blown out candle has a 50% chance to
							start a hunt regardeless of sanity.
						</li>
						<li>
							Each dead player increases the chance to hunt after
							blowing out candles by 25%, that means if 2 players
							are dead the chance is 100% of hunt after a blown
							out candle.
						</li>
						<li>
							Candles work similarly to crucifixes, it will be
							blown if onryo tries to hunt and block his hunt
							(candles take priority than crucifixes).
						</li>
						<h3>Test</h3>
						<p>
							Put candles on the ghost room, if the ghost start a
							hunt inside the room with the candles on it's
							definitely not an Onryo. Be careful, if you keep
							lighting the candles it may start a hunt outside the
							room far from the candle range.

						<h3>Test</h3>
						<p>
							Pay attention to the ghost speed every hunt, if you
							notice that sometimes it's a little bit slower than
							normal and sometimes is a little bit faster than

						<li>
							Causing glitching of all eletronic equipment in a

						<li>
							Building's lights and the breaker do not affect the

						<h3>Test</h3>
						<p>
							Drop some equipment close to your hiding spot, if
							when the equipment starts beeping at the hunt and
							the ghost gets faster you can know it's a Raiju.
							Just be careful if the ghost is already fast because
							there is some equipment where it is.
						</p>
						<p>
							A better and safer way to test is, let it hunt with
							all equipments on (careful to not die, since Raiju
							is extremely fast when there is equipment on), then,
							turn all the equipments off and check if the ghost
							speed decreased on the next hunt.

						<h3>Test</h3>
						<p>
							If the ghost is changing behaviour too much (is

							Passive sanity drain is doubled when cursed and will

						<h3>Test</h3>
						<p>
							First test is, did he responded someone on Spirit
							Box? Check it's sanity, if it lows down fast it's an
							Moroi.
						</p>
						<p>
							Second test is, when it first hunts, check the ghost
							speed. Than get your team sanity lower and let it
							hunt again, check if it got faster, if it did, it's
							an Moroi. If you didn't pay attention to the speed
							when your team had sanity, just take some pills and
							let it hunt, then check if it became slower.

							You can't hide from him, you have to run or just

						<p>
							Deogen test is, don't hide, stay in an open area

							come to you, I know, it will be fast and scary, but
							have faith it will stop, if the ghost did slow
							extremely down, just keep going backward and it will

							Has a chance to age every 1 to 2 minutes and every
							30 seconds if the previous aging attempt failed.
							Aging succeeds if a player is near the ghost when it
							attempts to age.
						</li>
						<li>Can age up to 10 times.</li>
						<li>
							When asking thw Ouija Board the Thaye's age, the
							responde will increase as the Thaye ages.
						</li>
						<h3>Test</h3>
						<p>
							Always pay attention to ghost speed at the very
							first hunt, if it's really fast, but it is slowing
							down after some hunts, it's a Thaye. (It will only
							slow down by time and if there is someone on it's
							room, if you and your team are usually outside it
							will age slower, therefore it will be slower to get
							to a slower ghost speed).
