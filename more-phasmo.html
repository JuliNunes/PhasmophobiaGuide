						<h3 class="byline">Spirit Box</h3>
						<p>
							Spirit Box is really simple, just turn it on and ask
							questions to the Ghost in the Ghost Room you don't
							need to say the Ghost name, just ask the question,
							the best way is to ask questions fast so you get an
							answer fast too, I like asking "Where are you?",
							"Are you here?" and "What do you want?".
						</p>
						<p>
							There is a good trick, just let the Spirit Box on
							and you don't even need to ask any question! If the
							ghost has Spirit Box it will eventually say
							something. I personally don't like doing this too
							much because the Spirit Box sound is annoying and it
							gets in the way of other sounds, like doors closing
							or objects being thrown, but it is something useful
							anyhow.
						</p>
					</section>
					<hr class="divider" />
					<section id="ghost-book">
						<h3 class="byline">Ghost Writing Book</h3>
						<p>
							There is no trick here, just put the book inside the
							ghost room, sometimes it takes forever and sometimes
							the Ghost writes it pretty fast.
						</p>
						<p>
							I lied, there is one small trick to know if there
							isn't Ghost Writing, if you see the ghost throwing
							the book you can be sure there won't be any Ghost
							Writing. I like to put the Ghost Book right below or
							on top of D.O.T.S so I know if the book moved a
							little.
						</p>

					<section id="emf">
						<h3 class="byline">EMF Reader</h3>
						<p>
							If you hear something being thrown run there and put
							that EMF Reader to work EMF is really useful to take
							photos too, if the EMF is beeping you can still take
							a picure of what was interacted with.

					<section id="uv-flash">
						<h3 class="byline">UV Flashlight</h3>
						<p>
							Nothing new to say here really, if you hear a door
							opening of closing run there with your UV Flashlight
							(or Glowstick) and check for fingerprints. Also
							check light switches if the Ghost turned any light
							on or off, check windows if you hear the Ghost
							hitting a window and check for footprints if the
							Ghost step on salt (Footprint doesn't count as
							Fingerprint, but is essential to do the Wraith test
							that you can check
							<a href="./ghosts.html">HERE</a>)
						</p>
					</section>
					<hr class="divider" />
					<section id="flash">
						<h3 class="byline">Flashlight</h3>
						<p>
							This Flashlight is weaker than the stronger
							flashlight and has a yellow light (while the strong
							one is white). I personally only play with the weak
							one, for me it makes the game a little more scarier
							and harder and I enjoy it, but that's a very
							personal choice.
						</p>
					</section>
					<hr class="divider" />
					<section id="video">
						<h3 class="byline">Video Camera</h3>
						<p>
							You can use the Video Camera by holding it and
							walking around the house looking at the video
							screen, you might see some Ghost Orbs.
						</p>
						<p>
							Placing the Video Camera in a good place that you
							can see most of the room will make the game a lot
							easier.
						</p>
					</section>
					<hr class="divider" />
					<section id="photo">
						<h3 class="byline">Photo Camera</h3>
						<p>
							Really useful to make some fat money, my advice is,
							always take pictures of door interaction if you do
							get fingerprints take 2 pictures, the next one will
							count as interaction. Also, if you are playing with
							other people everybody can take 1 photo of the same
							interaction (while it has EMF beeping) and it will
							count.
						</p>
						<p>
							Some people don't know that different photos means
							different money points, you need at least 500 points
							to get maximum money ($40), 400 to 499 points gives
							you $35, 300 to 399 $30 and goes on. Also, remember
							to take pictures close to what you want because that
							means how many stars you will get and how many
							points, here is the list of what gives more money
							points (I will only show 3 star points):
						</p>
						<ol class="list-none">
							<li>Ghost: 100 points</li>
							<li>Bone: 70</li>
							<li>Cursed possession: 60</li>
							<li>Fingerprints: 50</li>
							<li>Footprints and interaction: 40</li>
							<li>Dirty water: 35</li>
							<li>Dead body: 30</li>
						</ol>
						<p>
							That means if you want to get max photo money ($40)
							you need to take at least photo of: Ghost, Bone,
							Cursed possession, and 7 footprints and / or
							interaction (all 3 stars). There are other combos
							that make you reach 500 points.
						</p>
					</section>
					<hr class="divider" />
					<section id="dots">
						<h3 class="byline">D.O.T.S Projector</h3>
						<p>
							The best way to use DOTS is by putting it in a place
							that covers most of the Ghost Room, if you have 2
							DOTS put one a little far away from the other so you
							can cover most of the room. I also don't recomment
							putting it too close to a Video Camera because the
							image will be too bright to see something.

					<section id="candle">
						<h3 class="byline">Candle</h3>
						<p>
							Candles slow sanity drain in the darkness and also
							provides light source without attracting the Ghost.
							It is also useful to know if the Ghost is around and
							to slow sanity drain in big maps while searching for
							the Ghost Room or the breaker.
						</p>
						<p>
							The Ghost will ocasionally blow out a candle that is
							in 4 meters range of him and the candle will
							extinguish if not blown after 2.5 to 5 minutes.
						</p>
						<p>
							Candles are essential to test for Onryo, check out

					<section id="crucifix">
						<h3 class="byline">Crucifix</h3>
						<p>
							The Crucifix will stop a hunt from happening inside

							won't work for Cursed Hunts
						</p>
					</section>
					<hr class="divider" />
					<section id="glowstick">
						<h3 class="byline">Glowstick</h3>
						<p>
							The Glowstick works like the UV Flashlight, but it
							has a larger range around, is specially useful to
							look for Footprints since you can drop it on the
							ground next to a pile of salt.
						</p>
						<p>
							The Glowstick glows brightly for 1 minute then gets
							weaker, but still works.
						</p>
						<p>
							The Glowstick is also useful to mark places
							specially in big maps.

					<section id="head-camera">
						<h3 class="byline">Head Mounted Camera</h3>

						<p>
							It also emits a light that doesn't attract the
							Ghost, but is less bright than Candles.
						</p>

					<section id="parabolic">
						<h3 class="byline">Parabolic Microphone</h3>
						<p>
							It can be useful to find the Ghost Room, follow the
							sound (the numbers). Not very useful when playing
							with other people since them opening doors and
							fliping light switches can interfere.
						</p>
						<p>
							It is also an essential item to do one of the
							Banshee tests that you can check
							<a href="./ghosts.html">HERE</a>
						</p>
					</section>
					<hr class="divider" />
					<section id="salt">
						<h3 class="byline">Salt</h3>
						<p>
							Salt is useful to track where the Ghost is, it is
							also easiest way to get some photo money (only
							taking photos of salt won't give you the max amount
							of money), since you can take pictures of each
							Footprint.
						</p>
						<p>
							Salt is also essential to do a Wraith test and one
							of the Deogen tests that you can check both
							<a href="./ghosts.html">HERE</a>
						</p>
					</section>
					<hr class="divider" />
					<section id="pills">
						<h3 class="byline">Sanity Pills</h3>
						<p>
							It's useful to do tests involving sanity, like Moroi
							test or test if the Ghost will hunt above 50%
							sanity. You can check the Ghost Tests
							<a href="./ghosts.html">HERE</a>
						</p>
						<h4>Sanity recover each pill:</h4>
						<ol class="list-none">

					<section id="smudge">
						<h3 class="byline">Smudge Stick</h3>
						<p>
							Smudge Stick protect you from the Ghost when it's
							hunting, you should use the Smudge Stick when the
							Ghost is about to kill you (before it touches you)
							and then run and hide (You need a Lighter to use a
							Smudge Stick).
						</p>
						<p>
							It's useful to have a Smudge Stick when doing tests
							that require that you see the Ghost (like one of the
							Phantom test that you can check
							<a href="./ghosts.html">HERE</a>).
						</p>
						<h4>Tip</h4>
						<p>
							Always have a Smudge Stick and Lighter inside for
							when the Ghost starts a hunt and you are far from a
							Hiding Spot

					<section id="thermometer">
						<h3 class="byline">Thermometer</h3>
						<p>
							One of the most useful items to find the Ghost Room,
							you need to turn on the breaker first, then walk
							around with the Thermometer looking for a low
							temperature (below 10C could be indication depending
							on the weather outside, if it's snowing you should
							look for below 6C). If it's less than 3C it's 90%
							chance that you are in the Ghost Room.
						</p>
						<p>
							Low Temperature evidence is only when the
							temperature is negative.
						</p>
						<p>
							Thermometer can be buggy sometimes. Try using it
							inside a room for at least a few seconds to get a
							more accurate temperature.
						</p>
						<h4>Tip</h4>
						<p>
							If you suspect you are in the right room try walking
							out of it to see if the temperature is a lot
							different.

						<h3 class="byline">Bone</h3>
						<p>
							Bone is a Cursed Item that will appear in EVERY
							GAME. It can spawn anywhere on the map, even below
							carpets, on top of sofas and tables and one time it
							appeared inside a wall for me, so look carefully for
							it. Always take a picture before picking it up. It
							can have many different bone shapes.

					<section id="mirror">
						<h3 class="byline">Haunted Mirror</h3>
						<p>
							Just have a quick look at it, if you know the map it
							will be more than enough, if you see nothing
							compromising then maybe wait a little and look
							again, since waiting will make the ghost look
							elsewhere on the room.
						</p>
						<p>
							It will drain the player using the mirror sanity by
							10% very quick, and will break if it reaches 0%.
						</p>

					<section id="music-box">
						<h3 class="byline">Music Box</h3>
						<p>
							When activated walk around the map to find the
							Ghost, you will hear the singing louder the closer
							you are to the Ghost. If you get to at least 5
							meters of the Ghost it will manifest and walk
							towards the Music Box.
						</p>
						<p>
							If the Ghost touches the player with the Music Box
							or walk more than 5 seconds or the Music Box get
							thrown it will start a Cursed Hunt. If the Music Box
							is placed on the ground it won't hunt.
						</p>
						<p>
							If the player using the Music Box reaches 0% sanity
							it will initiate a Normal Hunt.
						</p>
						<p>
							Listening to the entire song will drain 75% sanity
							of any player that hears it.

						<h3 class="byline">Ouija Board</h3>
						<p>
							Ask a question, get an answer, the best question to
							ask is "Where are you?" so you know what room
							exactly the ghost is, but it will drain 40% sanity
							of the player that asked the question, if you
							already know where the ghost is, don't ask this.
						</p>
						<p>
							Ouija is good to trick a EMF 5 if the Ghost has that
							evidence you can ask questions that drain 5% sanity
							(the lowest), try asking 2 to 3 times to check if it
							will have an EMF 5 (there's a 25% chance of
							happening if that's an evidence).
						</p>
						<p>
							Another useful use is taking picture of every
							question, it will count as interaction, so ask 5%
							sanity question and take as many pictures as you
							want (1 pic per question per person).
						</p>
						<h4>Tip</h4>
						<p>
							Best questions to ask are: "Where are you?" (will
							drain 40% sanity), "Do you respond to everyone?"
							(will drain 20% sanity), "Where is the bone?" (will
							drain 20% sanity) and "How are you?" a few times to
							try for EMF 5 (will drain 5% sanity).

						<p>
							The Voodoo Doll is really useful to get evidence,
							probably the best Cursed Possession for it. So wait
							until you found the Ghost Room and use it to trigger
							evidence.
						</p>
						<p>
							It can be used up to 10 times, using it drops 5%
							sanity and will pin randomly a part of the Dolls
							body and will trigger an interaction, any
							interaction even EMF 5, D.O.T.S, Ghost Writing and
							Fingerprints.
						</p>
						<p>
							If the pin hits the Dolls heart it will drop 10%
							sanity and a Cursed Hunt will start.
						</p>
						<h4>Tip</h4>
						<p>
							If you are playing with a team you can use the
							Voodoo Doll strategically to get some evidence. Get
							all equipment inside (EMF, DOTS, UV and Writing
							Book), one player will stay in the van watching the
							camera to see if there'll be DOTS, one player will
							stay close to the Ghost Room (but not inside because
							a hunt might be triggered) and one player will hold
							the doll. The player holding the Doll will pin it
							ONE time, if it's not in the heart the player close
							to the room will go inside and check EMF, Writing
							and Fingerprints. If the heart was already pinned
							you can do it inside the room without fear of
							triggering a Cursed Hunt.
