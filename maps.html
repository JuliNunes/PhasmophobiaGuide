					<p class="text">
						The guide is mostly the map on the left with all
						locations, so here I will just put few more information.
					</p>
					<p class="text">
						Tanglewood is a small map (Tanglewood and Willow are the
						smallest maps), it has only 2 floors (first floor and
						basement) and is well known because it is the tutorial
						map of the game.
					</p>
					<p class="text">
						The Possible Hiding Spot in this map is behind a
						chiffonier in the dinning room, you can crounch there
						and it's very likely that you will stay alive if the
						ghost haven't seen you or sensed you (so turn off your
						equipment before you hide there).
					</p>
					<p class="text">
						I also don't advise hiding in the Foyer Hiding Spot on
						the right (close to the Living Room), the Ghost usually
						opens a lot that door. My favourites Hiding Spots in
						this map is the one in the Basement and Nursery and the
						Possible Hiding Spot in the Dining Room because there's
						no door that the Ghost can open.
					</p>
					<p class="text">
						Some say it is a good map for beginners, but I disagree,
						because if the Ghost Room is in the Foyer or Living Room
						it may get new player easily confused, the ghost will
						interact to a lot of places since those hallways are
						really big (if the Ghost is in the Living Room it will
						interact with the Hallway in front of it, where it has
						the door to the Basement and Utility Room).
