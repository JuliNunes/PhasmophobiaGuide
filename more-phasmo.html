					<p class="text">
						Spirit Box is really simple, just turn it on and ask
						questions to the Ghost in the Ghost Room you don't need
						to say the Ghost name, just ask the question, the best
						way is ask questions fast so you get an answer fast too,
						I like asking "Where are you?", "Are you here?" and
						"What do you want?".
					</p>
					<p class="text">
						There is a good trick, just let the Spirit Box on and
						you don't even need to ask any question! If the ghost
						has Spirit Box it will eventually say something. I
						personally don't like doing this too much because the
						Spirit Box sound is annoying and it gets in the way of
						other sounds, like doors closing or objects being
						thrown, but it is something useful anyhow.

					<h3 class="byline">Ghost Writing Book</h3>
					<p class="text">
						There is no trick here, just put the book inside the
						ghost room, sometimes it takes forever and sometimes the
						Ghost writes it pretty fast.
					</p>
					<p class="text">
						I lied, there is one small trick to know if there isn't
						Ghost Writing, if you see the ghost throwing the book
						you can be sure there won't be any Ghost Writing. I like
						to put the Ghost Book right below or on top of D.O.T.S
						so I know if the book moved a little.
