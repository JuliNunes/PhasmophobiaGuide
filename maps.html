					<p class="text">
						Tanglewood is a small map (one of the smallest with
						Willow Street House), it has only 2 floors (first floor
						and basemant) and is well known since is the tutorial
						map of the game.
					</p>
					<p class="text">
						Some say it is a good map for beginners, but I disagree,
						because it has one big problem, the ghost room can be in
						one of the hallways and this may get new player easily
						confused, the ghost will interact to a lot of places
						since the hallway is really big.
