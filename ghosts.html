						</p>
						<p class="text">
							The other way to test is by looking at it when it's

							completly ignores you, you can be sure it's a
							Banshee and you are not it's target (remember the Ghost may walk to you, but may not chase you). If it comes to
							you smudge it and get out. Then

							Drop some equipment close to your hiding spot, if

							A better and safer way to test is, let it hunt with
