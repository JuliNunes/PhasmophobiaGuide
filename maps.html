					<h2 class="title">Tanglewood Street House Guide</h2>
					<p class="text">
						The guide is mostly the map on the left with all
						locations, so here I will just put few more information.
					</p>
					<p class="text">
						Tanglewood is a small map (Tanglewood and Willow are the
						smallest maps), it has only 2 floors (first floor and
						basement) and is well known because it is the tutorial
						map of the game.
					</p>
					<h4>Possible Hiding Spot info</h4>
					<p class="text">
						The Possible Hiding Spot on this map is behind a
						chiffonier on the dinning room, you can crounch there
						and it's very likely that you will stay alive if the
						ghost haven't seen you or sensed you (so turn off your
						equipment before you hide there).
					</p>
					<h4>Best and Worst place for Ghost Room</h4>
					<p class="text">
						The worst Ghost Room you may get on this map are on the
						Foyer and on the Living Room because those are big and
						can be easily confused with other places, also Utility
						Room is no good either, since it means the Ghost will
						interact other places, like Garage and Kitchen, because
						it has almost nothing inside the Utility Room. The best
						is probably Nursery, because is small, but not that
						small and is easier to get evidence.
					</p>
					<h4>More info</h4>
					<p class="text">
						I also don't advise hiding inside the Foyer Hiding Spot
						on the right (close to the Living Room), the Ghost
						usually opens a lot that door. My favourites Hiding
						Spots in this map is the one in the Basement and Nursery
						and the Possible Hiding Spot in the Dining Room because
						there's no door that the Ghost can open.
					</p>
					<p class="text">
						Some say it is a good map for beginners, but I disagree,
						because if the Ghost Room is in the Foyer or Living Room
						it may get new player easily confused, the ghost will
						interact to a lot of places since those hallways are
						really big (if the Ghost is in the Living Room it will
						interact with the Hallway in front of it, where it has
						the door to the Basement and Utility Room).

				<img

					src="./images/willow.jpg"

				<section class="map-description">
					<h2 class="title">Willow Street House Guide</h2>
					<p class="text">
						Willow is the second smallest map this game has, it is
						one of my favourite maps, it has only first floor and
						basement like Tanglewood.
					</p>
					<h4>Possible Hiding Spot info</h4>
					<p class="text">
						The Possible Hiding Spots on this map are, behind the
						washing machine in the Utility Room, behind the tool
						desk in the Garage (I died on this spot a few times, but
						I still usually hide there) and behind the desk inside
						the Master Bedroom.
					</p>
					<h4>Best and Worst place for Ghost Room</h4>
					<p class="text">
						The worst place for Ghost Room you may get is the
						Basement Hallway, because it's really big, Garage is no
						good either. The best is probably the Bathroom or
						kitchen, they are small, easy to get evidence, easy to
						use crucifixes and there are a lot of stuff for the
						Ghost to interact with. The rooms in Basement might be
						good to for the same reason, but it's scarier to stay
						there.
