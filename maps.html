					<p class="text">
						The guide is mostly the map on the left with all
						locations, so here I will just put few more information.
					</p>
					<p class="text">
						Tanglewood is a small map (Tanglewood and Willow are the
						smallest maps), it has only 2 floors (first floor and
						basemant) and is well known beucase it is the tutorial
						map of the game.
					</p>
					<p class="text">
						The possible hiding spot in this map is behind a
						chiffonier in the dinning room, you can crounch there
						and it's very likely that you will stay alive if the
						ghost haven't seen you or sensed you (so turn off your
						equipment before you hide there).
					</p>
					<p class="text">
						Some say it is a good map for beginners, but I disagree,
						because it has one big problem, the ghost room can be in
						one of the hallways and this may get new player easily
						confused, the ghost will interact to a lot of places
						since the hallway is really big.
